Lengbanlist is a plugin designed for high-version Minecraft servers. It broadcasts information from the local banlist in the chat bar, enabling administrators to promptly notify players about banned information and enhancing the transparency and efficiency of server management.

## Key Features
- **Local banlist broadcasting**: Reads the server's local banlist in real-time and broadcasts it in the chat bar, ensuring all players are informed about bans promptly.
- **Customizable config**: Offers a flexible configuration file, allowing administrators to adjust broadcast formats, frequencies, and other parameters to meet personalized management needs.
- **Localized data storage**: Uses localized data storage to ensure data security and reliability.
- **Model functionality**: Supports multiple broadcast modes, enabling administrators to switch freely based on different scenarios.
- **Personalization**: Provides various model-based personalized styles, without emoticon support.

## Usage
1. Place the plugin file into the server's plugin directory.
2. Restart the server, and the plugin will automatically generate a default configuration file.
3. Modify the parameters in the configuration file as needed, such as broadcast intervals and message formats.
4. Reload the plugin or restart the server to apply the configuration.
